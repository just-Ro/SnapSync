# SnapSync
Windows app that fixes image and video creation dates. It grabs the date from the filename or the oldest date from the metadata and uses it as the media creation date. This is useful when photos and videos are not sorted properly in photo albums.

# Install Instructions
Download the `snapsync_installer.exe` installer and run it.

# Run the App
Open a folder, right-click on the folder background and click option **Run SnapSync Here**. The program will edit all files that have either image or video format in that folder.
